We're continuing our implementation of Portfolio Optimization Persistence by implementing task group number 1:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

#### Task Group 1: Backend Optimization Refactoring
**Assigned implementer:** api-engineer
**Dependencies:** None

- [ ] 1.0 Complete backend optimization refactoring
  - [ ] 1.1 Write 2-8 focused tests for caching and conditional execution logic
    - Limit to 2-8 highly focused tests maximum
    - Test critical cache hit/miss scenarios for `data_and_forecast_pipeline`
    - Test warm start vs. cold start execution paths in `optimize_portfolio`
    - Skip exhaustive coverage of mathematical correctness (covered by existing tests)
  - [ ] 1.2 Implement `data_and_forecast_pipeline` function
    - Extract data fetching, cleaning, and forecasting logic from `optimize_portfolio`
    - Decorate with `@cached` to enable L1/L2 caching
    - Ensure it returns `mu`, `S`, `latest_prices`, and `tickers`
  - [ ] 1.3 Refactor `optimize_portfolio` to use pipeline
    - Call `data_and_forecast_pipeline` first
    - Implement logic to use returned data for `EfficientFrontier`
    - Ensure `target_return`, `risk_tolerance`, and `risk_free_rate` are applied AFTER forecast retrieval
  - [ ] 1.4 Implement structured error handling
    - Catch `pypfopt` exceptions (e.g., infeasible solution)
    - Return specific JSON error response suggesting constraint adjustment
  - [ ] 1.5 Ensure backend tests pass
    - Run ONLY the 2-8 tests written in 1.1
    - Verify cache reuse works as expected
    - Do NOT run the entire test suite at this stage

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2026-02-04-portfolio-optimization-persistence/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.


## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.


## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `[task-number]-[task-title]-implementation.md`.

For example, if you've been assigned implement the 3rd task from `tasks.md` and that task's title is "Commenting System", then you must create the file: `agent-os/specs/2026-02-04-portfolio-optimization-persistence/implementation/3-commenting-system-implementation.md`.

Use the following structure for the content of your implementation documentation:
