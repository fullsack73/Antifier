# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
after replacing MPT with Black-Litterman model, winner-takes-all decision between 3 models with ensemble method, and implementing usage of log return, I have noticed significant speed decrease in running #file:portfolio_optimization.py  and i need to know why this happens and possibly fix it.
