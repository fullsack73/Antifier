# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
in order for a user to run this webapp in their local machine, they have to have python and all the modules at #file:requirements-pypi.txt plus the npm + vite.

i want to wrap this process in a single executable so all of the requirements are installed at single run of an exe.
